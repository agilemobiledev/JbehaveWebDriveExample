The purpose of this startup project is to get you going with jbehave(3.4.3) and WebDrive. In this example we do a simple and basic task.<br/>
* Load a website
* Click on a link
* And test if the redirected page is where we want to be

Required libraries
------------------
* [JBehaveWeb](http://jbehave.org/reference/downloads/web/bin/stable) - Add all the jars from lib folder
* [Selenium](http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-java-2.15.0.zip)   -   Add all the jar from lib folder and selenium-java-2.15.0.jar
* [JUnit](https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/downloads)

Run <b>ashraf.examples.webdriver.MyWebStories</b> as a unit test.

Note: This project implements the [page object pattern](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects). And it is pretty basic, so you can use this project as a startup as well.
